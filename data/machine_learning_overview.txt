Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Common types include supervised learning (e.g., classification, regression), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction), and reinforcement learning. It's widely used in recommendation systems, image recognition, and fraud detection.
